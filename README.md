# River masks Semi-authomatic Multi-Temporal extraction from Landsat SR images usign Google Earth Engine

Modified code from the Arctic_rivermasks branch for the use with service accounts and the auomatic dowload from drive.
For the automatic download you need to activate also the Drive API.

### Authentication process
To authenticate both Earth Engine and Drive you need to specify the name of the service account (the mail associated with it) in the <service_account> variable, the name of the json file where the credentials are stored in the <credentials_file> variable and the path of the folder where the file is stored in the <credentials_folder>. The author used a file that is placed in the same directory as the other scripts, but is not tracked on git to keep the credentials safe. In this file there is a function called <get_credentials> that takes no input and returns the value of this three variables.
